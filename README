This is a simple function for Arduino to be used with AX12A.

I have written this code to check whether AX12A servo is working or not.
I didn't know the ID and BaudRate stored in the EEPROM of the servo.

This code is a basic brute force funciton that will go through all 
possible values of BaudeRate and ID allowed in AX12A datasheet

If the appropriate configuration is found, the motor will start rotating 

By adjusting the delays, you can make the brute force method run faster

Once the servo starts rotating, you can conclude that your wiring and 
your servo are working properly.


I have used AX12A library which worked perfectly for me.
You can get it from here: https://github.com/jumejume1/AX-12A-servo-library

I have also used 74LS241N tri-state buffer to control UART 
communication.
Communication control pin is pin number 2.

The circuit which I used is based on the following diagram:

Tested on Arduino Uno R3
